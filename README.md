## 🎯 About Me

> **I help teams turn AI ideas into agentic, data-driven systems that are understandable, scalable, and actually used in everyday work.**

I believe the next wave of software won't just be apps and APIs, but **systems of intelligent agents** that understand context, remember decisions, and work alongside people.

My focus is on designing these **agentic AI systems** and the **data foundations** behind them, so businesses can move from one-off AI features to **reliable, evolving intelligence** in their everyday operations.

**My expertise sits at the intersection of:**
- 🧠 **Agentic & Generative AI** – shaping agent behaviours, goals, and workflows
- 🏗️ **System Architecture** – designing services, boundaries, and flows that can scale and evolve
- 📊 **Data-Driven Design** – building the context and foundations AI systems need to make better decisions

I work end-to-end: from defining how agents should think and act, to shaping the data and services that support them, to making sure the whole system can run reliably in production.

## 🧩 How I Think & Work

<div align="center">

> **I'm a systems thinker with a bias for clarity and delivery.**

</div>

When I approach a problem or a system, I focus on:

- 🎯 **Intent** – what success looks like and who it serves
- 🧱 **Structure** – clear responsibilities for components, agents, and services
- 🧮 **Context** – the data and signals a system needs to make good decisions
- ⚙️ **Operational reality** – deployment, observability, failure modes, iteration loops
- 🤝 **Alignment** – making sure engineers, product, and decision-makers share the same mental model of the system

**The goal is always the same:**  
Build solutions that teams can **run, understand, and evolve with confidence.**
