Innovation in Agentic AI · AI Strategy & Architecture · Data-Driven Systems

I focus on designing and guiding **agentic AI systems** that can reason, remember, and adapt — supported by data and architectures that are built for real use, not just demos.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Agentic and generative AI  
- Data-driven system design (including graph and vector representations of knowledge)  
- Scalable, maintainable software architecture  
- Teams that turn ideas into reliable products

## 🔭 WHAT I WORK ON

- AI systems where agents have **goals, tools, memory, and context**  
- Architectures that make it possible to **observe, understand, and improve** AI behaviour over time  
- Data layers that give systems the **context they need** to make better decisions  
- Translating product and business needs into **clear technical designs and roadmaps**

## 🧠 HOW I THINK ABOUT SOLUTIONS

When I look at a problem or a system, I care about:

- **Intent** – what we are actually trying to achieve and for whom  
- **Structure** – clear boundaries between components, services, and responsibilities  
- **Context** – how data (including graph and vector representations) informs decisions  
- **Operational reality** – deployment, monitoring, and iteration designed in from the start  
- **Alignment** – making sure engineering, product, and decision-makers share the same picture

The goal is always the same:  
> build solutions that are understandable, testable, and dependable in production.

## 🧩 WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT HERE

This space is for:

- Experiments around **agentic workflows and orchestration**  
- Patterns for **context-aware systems** using richer data representations  
- Architecture ideas and small, focused examples that reflect how I approach AI-driven products
